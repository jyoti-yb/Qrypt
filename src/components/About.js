      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project is a web-based messaging app that ensures security against future quantum computing threats by using advanced cryptographic techniques. It allows users to send and receive messages that are encrypted in a way that makes them very hard to intercept or decode by unauthorized parties.
